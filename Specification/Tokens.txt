A digital logic file is built out of tokens, each token is seperated by a blank character, such as a space or new line. All built in operators, language syntax, variables, constants, expressions, and functions are built out of space seperated tokens. Tokens can be made out of any non whitespace space character. For example, the token 'hello' could be used as a function name or variable, but 'h;110<<?()' is just as valid.
There are a number of built-in reserved tokens. Operators: ! _ & | : / ? Expressions: = Blocks: ( ) Comments: # ## Functions: << // >> Any token that consists purely of '0's and '1's is a constant. The name of the DigitalLogic file currently being run is the program return value (e.g. Hello.dl). Beyond that there are no reserved names for variables, functions, parameters etc. More detail about how to use every token, and what they do is available in the relevant specification document.
Comments are supported in Digital Logic, to start a line comment use the # token. It must have a space on both sides to be a token (same as any other token) which is required to correctly start a line comment. After the line comment is found, the rest of the tokens on the line are simply ignored. The ## token starts a block comment, and all tokens are ignored until the corresponding block comment token is found.
