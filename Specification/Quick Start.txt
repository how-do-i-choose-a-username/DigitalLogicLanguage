Digital Logic is awesome!

To run a Digital Logic file, start by opening the folder which contains the jar file
Then, run the command 'java -jar DigitalLogic.jar' followed by the path to the .dl or .dlc file you want to run

See the following examples for Digital Logic programming 1100101.

Assigning the variable 'hello' the constant value of '101'
hello = 101

Reading a single character from the user into the variable 'hello'
hello = _

Make sure that all operators, variables, equals signs etc. are seperated by a space

'And' operator example
a = b & c

The basic operators to start with are 'and &', 'or |', 'not !', and 'terminal _'

This is a comment in a block
See? It goes for multiple lines

Output the character 'A' (uses ascii codes)
_ = 01000001

#   Hello world program in Digital Logic
_ = 01001000    # H
_ = 01100101    # e
_ = 01101100    # l
_ = 01101100    # l
_ = 01101111    # o
_ = 00100000    # space
_ = 01010111    # W
_ = 01101111    # o
_ = 01110010    # r
_ = 01101100    # l
_ = 01100100    # d
_ = 00100001    # !
#   End of the Hello World program

Functions are cool! A function is declared like so
<< FunctionName ReturnValue Parameter1 Parameter2 // // >>

Functions can have any number of parameters (including none)
Functions can have any name that is not already in use

The center block of function is to get a value (which was assigned to the return value)
<< True Return // Return = ! 0 // >>
#   This is how to call the function that we just wrote
variable = True

The last block is to set a value. The set value is retrieved from the return value
<< output value // // _ = value >>
#   And now we call the function by setting to it
output = 01000001
