# Digital Logic Language
My third version of a custom programming language.

A minimal custom syntax and code structure, with a Java interpreter and runtime.

The language is slightly esoteric, with minimal control flow, and very few available operators.

Start with 'and', 'or', 'not', 'bits', 'reflection' and 'terminal' operators. From there build up functions to perform complex tasks such as division.

## Quick code examples
See Examples for several programs to perform basic programming tasks.

### XOR Function
```
<< ^ return param1 param2 //
    and = param1 & param2
    or = param1 | param2
    return = or & ! and
>>
```

### Hello World
```
_ = 01001000
_ = 01100101
_ = 01101100
_ = 01101100
_ = 01101111
_ = 00100000
_ = 01010111
_ = 01101111
_ = 01110010
_ = 01101100
_ = 01100100
_ = 00100001
```
