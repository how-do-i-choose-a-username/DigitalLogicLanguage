# Expected output: Terminal echoes whatever you type (Ctrl + D to terminate). By default Digital Logic does not echo characters to the terminal

# Function to read a character from the terminal, output it, then recursively call itself
<< ECHO return // 
    _ = _
    none = ECHO
// >>

# Digital logic has no looping structure, so recursion is used instead
none = ECHO
